# Fall-Detection-Simulator-
Built an embedded system that simulates calling the police when a person falls on the ground without getting back up.
Designed the system using 2 different microcontrollers  communicating with each other to sense the person's motion, display the person's  current status and activate the Morse code SOS sound after they fall without getting back up ( which is equivalent to 10 -ve Accelerometer readings within the last 15 readings).
